What strategy will you use to robustly extract and filter your data of interest? How do you plan to handle missing data?\n","\n","* A good way to start is to print out each line, then practice parsing them to see if you can recover the fields of interest\n","\n","* A starting solution for parsing .vcfs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dceoy/99d976a2c01e7f0ba1c813778f9db744 This solution does **NOT** work due to the changes we've made but can be modified to work. As with any solution that needs modifications, it may take less time to make your own solution!\n","\n","* Filter out junk and lines with no mutation data. Just focus on the data your need to deliver to your boss. \n","\n","* Pandas and NumPy parsers correctly recognize the end of each line in in the ClinVar file.\n","\n","* The unit of observation of this dataset is one row per mutation.\n","\n","* This is similar to a task that one of us tackled at work. You can answer the question with the information provided below or using the (partial) data dictionary file at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lx9yHdlcqmU_OlHiTUXKC_LQDqYBypH_/view?usp=sharing. Our goal is to see that you can put together a sensible plan, implement a solid parsing strategy, and document and justify the decisions that you made."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"vxoh6uLEg7Tr"},"source":["### VCF file description (Summarized from version 4.1)\n","\n","```\n","* The VCF specification:\n","\n","VCF is a text file format which contains meta-information lines, a header line, and then data lines each containing information about a position in the genome.
